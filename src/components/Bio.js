            My name's Atravias
        and I'm interested in computer programming and business management. I like to
        play guitar,

        games, sports, go to the gym, eat food, and find new places to eat food. I like to have fun but get
        things done
        while I do. Some people may describe me as fun, adventurous, or creative. Others may call me wreckless,
        loud, yet funny.
        I've been working ever since my first job at 17, and nothing has stopped me from making my own journey.
        I
        never wanted
        to stop looking for what I wanted to do, and when I found out about computer programming, I wanted to
        learn! So
        after trying out a few things online, and enjoying doing it, it seemed like a skill that would benefit
        me
        in my
        future.
        I then decided to give it a shot when I found a class online through the University of utah.
        I am currently enrolled in a computer programming class with the University of Utah and learning new
        skills
        every week.
